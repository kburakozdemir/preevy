  for docker-comopse applications with minimal configuration
</span>

## Introduction

Use Preevy to provision your [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application with minimal configurations.<br/>
Simply run `preevy up`, and Preevy will return a public URL for every service in your configuration.

You can read more about the Preevy [origin story and motivation](/intro/motivation).

## Getting Started

Preevy is designed to be easy to use, with an API smiliar to [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

1. Install the CLI globally

  ```bash npm2yarn
  npm install -g preevy
  ```

  Or use it directly

  ```bash
  npx preevy <command>
  ```

2. Make sure you're logged in to AWS. See [AWS lightsail credentials configurations](http://localhost:3001/drivers/aws-lightsail#credentials-configuration).

3. Set up a profile

  ```bash
  preevy init
  ```

4. From the same directory you run `docker comopse up` run:

  ```bash
  preevy up
  ```
<br />

:::info Cloud provider credentials
Managing and provisioning preview environments in Preevy, requires access and credentials to a cloud provider. Currently only AWS is supported, but more providers are [coming soon](/roadmap#more-cloud-drivers).
Once you install and set up the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), Preevy will recognize and employ your configuration settings.
